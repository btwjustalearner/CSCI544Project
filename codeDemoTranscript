overview:
Research has been done to better understand the stock market and conduct predictions on it. 
Time series models have been used for centuries but it alone usually can not provide a good 
forecasting of the stock prices trend. We want to take advantage of financial news which 
can bring additional information on market trends. We plan to use the state-of-art NLP 
technology to extract the event inside the news text and measure the impact of this event 
on the related company’s stock. This impact will be stacked with the current time series model.





data collection:


For the news data part(这是为什么我们根据新闻数据来搜集股票数据):
It is harder to target a financial news dataset of Chinese than that of English, also Collectings 
stock price data is easier than finding financial news data. We put a focus on finding the proper
Chniese financial news dataset.  


The Chinese corpus we accessed is news on public companies in China in 2019 which has17149 records with 
date, code, company, title and text. The English corpus has 1 million records on 4 companies (Amazon, 
Apple, Google and Facebook) with publish date, title and text. English corpus is much larger than Chinese.
We took a sample from English corpus to deal with this problem. There are more companies in Chinese corpuus
but it shouldn't have too big impact since each record is a (company, date) pair rather than company itself.


data cleaning:


We have filtered the news data since we want to have more information for each date point to do 
a better prediction. We take a date into acount when it has more than 2 news for the same
company on that day. For company, the company has more than 1 valid date point will be considered 
as valid company.  

(run the scripts of extraction)

This process produce 2 files. The ChineseCompany_2.csv provides information for collecting Stock 
price. It tells the company and related time series of which the stock price should be collected.
Another file /data/traindata(ch).csv is the filtered training data.


time series model:
Now we have the news data and ground truth. How do we gather them together?
