overview:



data collection:


For the news data part(这是为什么我们根据新闻数据来搜集股票数据):
It is harder to target a financial news dataset of Chinese than that of English, also Collectings 
stock price data is easier than finding financial news data. We put a focus on finding the proper
Chniese financial news dataset.  


data cleaning:


We have filtered the news data since we want to have more information for each date point to do 
a better prediction. We take a date into acount when it has more than 2 news for the same
company on that day. For company, the company has more than 1 valid date point will be considered 
as valid company.  

(run the scripts of extraction)

This process produce 2 files. The ChineseCompany_2.csv provides information for collecting Stock 
price. It tells the company and related time series of which the stock price should be collected.
Another file /data/traindata(ch).csv is the filtered training data.


time series model:
Now we have the news data and ground truth. How do we gather them together?
